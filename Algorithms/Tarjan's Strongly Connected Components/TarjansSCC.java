    Tarjan's Strongly Connected Components algorithm using an adjacency list
    reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyWtx7q2D7Y&ab_channel=WilliamFiset

        In a graph like structure, Strongly Connected Components (SCC's) can be thought of as self-contained cycles within
        a directed graph where every vertex in a given cycle can reach every other vertex in the same cycle.

        Low-Link Value: The low link value of a node is the smallest[lowest] node id (number) reachable from that nodes
        when doing a DFS (including itself)

        Ex:
            given the following directed graph,

            [0] ---> [1] ---> [3]
             ^      / |        |
             |    /   |        |
             |  <     v        v
            [2] ---> [4] ---> [5]
                       ^-------â”˜
           0's LLV is 0
           1's LLV is 0
           2's LLV is 0

           3's LLV is 3

           4's LLV is 4
           5's LLV is 4

           Note: All nodes with the same LLV belong to the same SCC, hence this graph has 3 SCC's.

           SCC's vary depending on where the DFS search begins leading to wrong identifications of SCC. Tarjan's SCC
           algorithm maintains an invariant that prevents SCC's to interfere with each others' LLV's. To cope with the
           random traversal order of the DFS, Tarjan's algorithm maintains a set (Often as a stack) of valid nodes from
           which to update low-link values from.

           Nodes are added to the stack[set] of valid nodes as they're explored for the first time.

           Nodes are removed from the stack[set] each time a complete SCC is found.

           **Updating a nodes Low-link Value Condition**
           if "u" and "v" are nodes in a graph and we're currently exploring "u" then the new low-link update condition
           is:
                To update node "u" LLV to node "v" LLV there has to be a path of edges from "u" to "v" and node "v"
                must be on the stack, i.e. "v" and "u" are part of the same SCC.

          Time complexity of finding all SCC is O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges
          in the graph
