# Data-Structures & Algorithms
Implementation of various data Structures and Algorithms using Java. Some implementations utilize Java Generics to allow flexibility in usability.

## Data Structures Implemented:
    - Binary Search Tree
    - Deque [Array & Linked List]
    - Hash Table [Array]
    - Heap [Array]
    - Linked List / Doubly Linked List
    - Positional List [Linked List]
    - Priority Queue [Linked List]
    - Queue [Linked List & Circular Array]
    - Stack [Linked List & Array]
**structures in [ ] are what was used for implementation**
