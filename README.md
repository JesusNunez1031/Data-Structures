# Data-Structures & Algorithms
Implementation of various data Structures and Algorithms using Java. Some implementations utilize Java Generics to allow flexibility in usability. Application programs are also included to showcase usability of data structures and algorithms.
##Data Structures Implemented:
    - Binary Search Tree
    - Deque [Array & Linked List]
    - Hash Table [Array]
    - Heap [Array]
    - Linked List / Doubly Linked List
    - Positional List [Linked List]
    - Priority Queue [Linked List]
    - Queue [Linked List & Circular Array]
    - Stack [Linked List & Array]
**structures in [ ] are what was used for implementation**
